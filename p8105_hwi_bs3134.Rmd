# Problem 1
```{r chunk_name}
library(tidyverse)
data_hw=tibble(
  unif = runif(n=10,min=0,max=5),
  logic= unif>2,
  char = 1:10,
  fact = factor(c("Male","Male","Female","Male","Female","Male","Female","Female","Female","Male"))
)
data_hw

```



* The mean of unif is `r mean(data_hw$unif)`
* The mean of logic is `r mean(data_hw$logic)`
* The mean of char is `r mean(data_hw$char)`
* The mean of fact is `r mean(data_hw$fact)`
