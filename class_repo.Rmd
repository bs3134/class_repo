# Problem 1
```{r chunk_name}
x = runif(n=10,min=0,max=5)
x
sum(x > 2)

```
* Therefore, there are `r sum(x>2)` elements greater than 2.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
y=tibble(
  vec_char=1:10,
  vec_factor=factor(c("Male","Male","Female","Male","Female","Male","Female","Female","Female","Male"))
)
y
```
