# Problem 1
```{r chunk_name}
library(tidyverse)
data_hw=tibble(
  unif = runif(n=10,min=0,max=5),
  logic= unif>2,
  char = c("1995/03/18","1996/03/18","1997/03/18","1998/03/18","1999/03/18","2000/03/18","2001/03/18","2002/03/18","2003/03/18","2004/03/18"),
  fact = factor(c("Male","Male","Female","Male","Female","Male","Female","Female","Female","Male"))
)
data_hw
guess_1=as.numeric(data_hw$logic)
guess_1
guess_2=as.numeric(data_hw$char)
guess_2
guess_3=as.numeric(data_hw$fact)
guess_3

```



* The mean of unif is `r mean(data_hw$unif)`
* The mean of logic is `r mean(data_hw$logic)`
* The mean of char is `r mean(data_hw$char)`
* The mean of fact is `r mean(data_hw$fact)`
